## Overview
> Web3 is the third generation of the web, or the commonly known and referred to communication network that we all love and call the internet. But Web3 is much more than the commonly known communication network and its uses. Web3 technology is inherently about the user controlled internet. It is being achieved by a growing stack of decentralized technologies, such as blockchains, smart contracts, oracles, crypto wallets, storage networks, and more.   


## Objective
> In this project the main objective is to build an end-to-end Web3 decentralized application on the Algorand Blockchain that will help its client generate and distribute Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as certificates that will represent the successful completion of a task or project to its customers, and allow its customers that are holding these NFTs to interact with a smart contract to perform pre-defined actions.
